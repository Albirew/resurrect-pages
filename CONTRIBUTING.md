# Contributing to resurrect-pages

I love pull requests from everyone. 
In fact, since I don't have much time for coding (neither much skill, I must admit), 
any pull request is very welcome!

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help me by submitting an issue to this [GitHub Repository][github]. 
Even better you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.
